Problem description

Currently, Culinary and Hospitality Education programs are active and presential courses which play crucial role in maintaining their own restaurants 
located inside of their campus. These restaurants supported by students and professors from Culinary & hospitality programs. They are financially supported 
on the sales on their meals-made products and raw products such as vegetable and fruits cultivated in their facilities. The main customers are composed by 
local neighbors, and college company partners. Another main source of profit for those schools are based on performing in-person meetings and greeting 
clients in their facilities. 

Since March 11st, Ontario Government has declared state of Emergency in the city of Toronto and temporary suspended all classes, restaurants, and any other 
food-related services due to Covid19 outbreak. All Culinary and Hospitality School are officially temporarily closed in Toronto amid covid19 pandemic. 

As consequence, Culinary and Hospitality School are in a critical and vulnerable situation and facing possible bankruptcies. Student, professors, 
local restaurants, and consumers have technical difficulty to consume and contact any Culinary and Hospitality School. Furthermore, it is hard to 
track their inventory, placed orders and follow-up deliveries to clients and any other company partners.

In response to the current situation, our system will be deployed in online server and accessible by mobile application. As the main function, 
the new app will be able to register and maintain interaction with clients and restaurant-company partners. As outstanding function, 
the application will allow the clients to place an order and follow up the status of each order using an interface connected with our database.
In the benefit of our clients, students will earn 50% of total sales, 20% will be donate to vulnerable long-term home care institutions and others 
will be invest on their own School to maintain and update of the mobile application. Moreover, half of advertising revenue generated for the system 
will be donated to Covid19 emergency programs.
